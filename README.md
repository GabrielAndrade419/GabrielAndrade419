# Hey there, welcome to my space!

I'm Andrade_DEV, a passionate **Computer Science** student always eager to learn. I see coding as an adventure, and I'm constantly diving into new languages, frameworks, and technologies.

My projects on this page are a reflection of my current learning process and my passion for building things from scratch.

Got a cool idea or just want to chat about tech? Let's connect! I'm a firm believer that we learn best when we learn together.
